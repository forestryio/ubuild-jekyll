# Editing Your uBuild Site
This website uses a Jekyll theme called uBuild, which was designed to use Forestry's Blocks feature to create modular page layouts.

### Using Forestry
Forestry's [editing docs](https://forestry.io/docs/editing/) provide a good overview of how to use the editor.

### Using uBuild
To create a new landing page, navigate to the [pages section](#/sections/pages/) and click the **Create New** Button and select **Page**. Enter the title for your page, and select **Page builder** for the front matter template. Start building your page by adding **Page Sections** from the dropdown.

Without any page sections, your uBuild page is a blank slate! You will likely want to start the page with a **Navigation header** or a **Simple header**.
